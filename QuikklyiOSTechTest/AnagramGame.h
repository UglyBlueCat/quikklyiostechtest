/**
 * Class managing an anagram game, similar to the TV show Countdown.
 * <p/>
 * The game is constructed with a base set of letters, e.g. the string "areallylongword",
 * which may be assumed to be all in lowercase, and with no whitespace or special characters. Users then attempt to create
 * words out of the letters, and score one point for each letter used. The submissions must be "real words": use
 * the WordDictionary to check each submission.
 * <p/>
 * For example:
 * "no" is an acceptable submission, with score 2
 * "grow" is an acceptable submission, with score 4
 * "bold" is not an acceptable submission
 * "glly" is not an acceptable submission
 * "woolly" is an acceptable submission with score 6
 * "adder" is not an acceptable submission
 * <p/>
 * Throughout this test, you need not worry about whitespace, special characters, or uppercase. You may assume
 * that both the original string of letters and all submissions contain none of these.
